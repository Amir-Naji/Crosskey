 - The application is written with C# .Net core 3.1.
 - The easiest way is to open the solution with visual studio, and set the either Crosskey or Crosskey.Web as default project. 
 - The Crosskey project reads the data from the text file, and the Crosskey.Web reads it from the input from html UI.
 - The web UI is pretty simple, and just to show that the data can be sent.
 - The file path is read from appsettings.json in Services, and it can be changed to whatever path you want.
 - The data file is in the repository for now.
